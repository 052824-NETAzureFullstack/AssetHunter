# AssetHunter

## An app that will compute a customized strategy for a user to acquire a new financial asset.

## Functional Components:
- Angular SPA: v18

## User Stories:
- As a user, I will be able to input basic, estimated information about my finances and the type of asset that I am hunting.

- The app will then use the entered information to compute and display a few visual options for possible assets in your area.

- As a user, I should now be able to select one of the three proposed assets (or redo my search if necessary)

-The app will then display the chosen asset and all of it's current information (price, size, color, etc).

-The app will also compute 3 local loan options based on earlier user input.

-Finally, the app will also compute 3 proposed strategies for successfully acquiring the asset and subsequently turning it into profit!

- As a user, I should be able to extrapolate all of the resulting (palatable) information by downloading it as a .pdf file.
