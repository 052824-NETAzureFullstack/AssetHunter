# AssetHunter

## An app that will compute a customized strategy for a user to acquire a new financial asset.

## Functional Components:
- Angular SPA: v18

## User Stories:
- As a user, I will be able to input basic information about my finances and convey the type of asset that I am hunting (Auto? Home? Etc).

- The app will then use the entered information to extrapolate and display a few visual options for matching assets in your area.

- As a user, I will now be able to select one of the three proposed assets (or redo my search if necessary).

-The app will then display the selected asset and all relevant information (price, make, model, sqft, etc).

-Next, the app will compute 3 local loan options based on earlier user input.

-The app will then also compute 3 proposed strategies for successfully acquiring the asset and subsequently turning it into profit!

- As a user, I should be able to extrapolate all of the resulting information by downloading it as a .pdf file.
